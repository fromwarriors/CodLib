CodLib
======

A code library that I'm working on.(OpenSource)

simply, <code>cd</code> to the folder you put codlib.py in and type the command: 
<pre><code>user@user:~/ python3 codlib.py</code></pre>
windows: 
<pre><code>C:\ python3 codlib.py</code></pre>

Also, you may do whatever you like with files(contribute to our opensource
project or break the files :P). I ask to please contribute as much as you can.

CodLib is a code library which stores code snippets and recalls them. It is multi-platform(Windows and Linux).

Future Updates: Use JSON files to store snippets, GUI, more features
