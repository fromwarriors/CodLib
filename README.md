CodLib
======

A code library that I'm working on.(OpenSource)
Each branch I make is for each version. The master branch will always have the newest version of the program
======

cd to the folder you put codlib.py in and type the command: python codlib.py

Also, you may do whatever you like with files(Slander it, make a bible, use it as a dildo, and/or contribute to our opensource
project). I ask to please contribute as much as you can. This is for you guys <3
