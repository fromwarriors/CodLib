CodLib
======

A code library that I'm working on.(OpenSource)
Each branch I make is for each version. The master branch will always have the newest version of the program
======

cd to the folder you put codlib.py in and type the command: python codlib.py

Also, you may do whatever you like with files(contribute to our opensource
project or break the files :P). I ask to please contribute as much as you can.

CodLib is a code library which stores code snippets and recalls them. It is multi-platform(Windows and Linux).

Future Updates: Use JSON files to store snippets, GUI, more features

UPDATE 5/11/13:
GUI coming in beta

UPDATE 8/9/13:
Added new-style classes, fixed the Ascii Art. Updated to python 3.3.2[newest version]
Bugs: Menus in codlib.py need to be fixed. Avoid elif mayhem.
